##__Willis Guo and Natalie Volk__

This repository contains code and resources related to the research paper "Analysis of Transformer-based Models for Stack Overflow Duplicate Question Detection" which explores the efficacy of using transformer models for automatic duplicate detection in Community Question Answering (CQA) programming sites like Stack Overflow. Currently, the removal of duplicate posts is a manual process that is time-consuming and retroactive. Our study contributes a novel technique by combining the triplet loss from S-BERT with two state-of-the-art models for bimodal Natural Language / Programming Language (NL-PL) problems, namely MQDD and CodeBERT. We also provide a comparison of their capabilities. The code and resources provided here can be used to replicate our experiments and further extend the research in this domain.
